## Discord sucks

I have been disatisfied with discord for a few years by now, the main reasons that most people will
agree with me, are it's slow, sluggish, bloated, and that it gets worse over time.

- Reduced upload size from 50mb to 10mb
- Ugly UI revamps
- Literally ships with an entire browser (chromium due to electron)

But there are a few more personal reasons for me.

Ignoring the fact that I am in 100 servers and literally can't join any more,
as someone who spends most of his day in the terminal, writing code with NVIM (btw),
I really missed vim motions in discord, they are great and I'd probably talk about them in the future.

## Searching for alternatives

Vim motions are so ubiquitous they are practically everywhere, not just coding editors like Zed and
vsc\*de but also note taking apps like Obsidian, and heck, even google docs have an extension for them.

Surely an app as popular as Discord will have them right? well after some searching I found
[Cordless](https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/cordless), a discord client in the terminal, great!

Reading the readme, I immediately got dissapointed, the project has been shutdown.
The reason was due to a high risk of Discord banning users for ToS violation, so I couldn't even make my own client!

## The idea

So I thought to myself, if Discord doesn't let me make a client, I'll write my own Discord, complete
with a backend, frontend and most importantly, vim motions!

Great, now that I have the idea, what languages do I use for the backend and the frontend?

I heard that golang is a really good language for the backend, due to it's concurrency model making
it easy to handle a ton of connections simultaneously.

And what about the frontend? I'd need to find some library to help me make a TUI (terminal UI),
After some searching, I found [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) from [charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet),
a golang library for creating TUIs, perfect.

This has the added benefit of the backend and frontend being able to share types as they are
written in the same language.

## The release

After months of work, I am happy to present...

[Eko](https://github.com/kyren223/eko) - a terminal-native discord alternative for terminal enthusiasts!
